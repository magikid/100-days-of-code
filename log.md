# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20 Aug 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started new URL shortener website.  Made tons of progress.
Just need to add authorization to it.

**Thoughts:** I need to pace myself better and commit more often.  I banged this
site out before I even had a chance to catch my breath.  Consequently, I have a
single, huge, ugly commit that does everything so far.
