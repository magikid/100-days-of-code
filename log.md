# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: 23 Aug 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got my shortener to deploy!

**Thoughts**: It would have been nice if there were an up-to-date walk through
of deploying a rails application with capistrano.

### Day 3: 22 Aug 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on getting the deployment to work with capistrano.

**Thoughts**: Something about NFSN really doesn't like it.  It was like pulling teeth and I've
just run out of time to play with it.  Devops is hard.

### Day 2: 21 Aug 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added authorization to shortener site.  Now unauth'd
people are only allowed to login.  Also started getting the site deployed with
capistrano.

**Thoughts**: I tried to get some tests working and it's gonna be a nightmare to
clean them all up.  I'm half tempted to just delete the stuff that in them and
rewrite each one.  I forgot that I really have the rails-generated tests.

### Day 1: 20 Aug 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started new URL shortener website.  Made tons of progress.
Just need to add authorization to it.

**Thoughts:** I need to pace myself better and commit more often.  I banged this
site out before I even had a chance to catch my breath.  Consequently, I have a
single, huge, ugly commit that does everything so far.
